This repository contains all the applications that were developed over the 2013 Spring semester for 21W.789 Communication With Mobile Devices.
Included are: 
* Network application
* SchMap applicaiton

The Network application was created for an assignment focused on documenting latency, throughput and performance of mobile applications through various connections, such as WiFi, 3G and 4G. 
SchMap application is the final project created for 21W.789. SchMap is a schedule, calendar, To-Do list all centered on a map. Using Java and Google Map API, we developed this application as a tool for MIT students to help coordinate and plan their already limited time and help improve efficiency.
